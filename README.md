This is my personal website. I've created a basic site with links to key parts of my life, such as my ongoing original websites and a Google Site about my prior career as an academic.

Some issues I am having:
*I would like to have a smoother dropdown menu system. The one I have now is serviceable, but the timer element will annoy some users. I'd like to have a dropdown that remains open as long as the user hovers over it. (I experimented with a non-timer jQuery version using hover(), but that created an undesirable "sea sickness" effect wherein the menus kept bobbing up and down when the user's mouse grazed the menu area.)
*On a related note, the dropdown menu itself should be formatted better to improve its aesthetic and optimally allow for more links.
*The text could also stand to be formatted better in the "I am an..." blurb below my pictures in the tablet and mobile versions.
